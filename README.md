# facerecognition
  facerecognition is based on [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet), and the model is also downloaded here. Currently under development. The search engine is based on elasticsearch, and a plugin is needed for ElasticSearch vector scoring, from [here](https://github.com/MLnick/elasticsearch-vector-scoring). [dlib](http://dlib.net/) is used to detect face.
