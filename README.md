# facerecognition
facerecognition is based on [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet), and the model is also downloaded here. The search engine is based on elasticsearch, and a plugin is needed for ElasticSearch vector scoring, from [here](https://github.com/MLnick/elasticsearch-vector-scoring). [dlib](http://dlib.net/) is used to detect face.

Currently suspended.

The base function is finished, and it can runs normaly, but the accuracy is not high, currently, 1:N face recognition is not good enough, so more research is needed.
